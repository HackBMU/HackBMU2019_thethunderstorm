<h5>The basic idea is to develop the tool that enables to get detailed audio and text description of a video content and is not prone to networking casulaties and is independently functioning standalone system. </h5>
    </br></br>
 
 <h3> 
    Following benefits are expected to be achieved with this model:</h3></br>
    1. Real-time Processing which is not achievable with APIs.</br>
    2. Content processing on local system isolated from the risks of network failure increasing the reliability.</br>
    3. No network dependency.</br>
    4. No cloud services required.</br>
    5. Isolated and standalone environment.
 </br> 
 <h3> The content of input data may be of following types</h3></br>
    1. Confidential Videos which can't be given to third parties.</br>
    2. Entertainment content </br>
    3. Surveillancing data
    4. Educational and training data </br>
    5. Interactive data with daily activities</br>
   <br></br><br></br>
   
   <h3>Used approaches and Technology</h3>
      1. Convolutional neural network</br>
      2. Recurrent neural network </br>
      3. Image and Video processing </br>
